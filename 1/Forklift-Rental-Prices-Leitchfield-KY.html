Not move the truck and remain at the controls at all times, if operating an industrial lift truck with a forklift platform with an employee on the platform. For trucks with tilting forks, the forks shall be horizontal or at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable.

<p>This added weight increases the lifting capacity of the unit to between 2,200 and 4,000 lb. The load center is the distance from the forks to the center of gravity of the load. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA.

The company builds 350,000 trucks each year, and their lowest lift weight is only 1,500 lbs while their heavy duty units can lift 100,000 lbs. Whether you're searching for your first lift truck, replacing a piece of equipment or expanding your fleet, we hope this breakdown of the various forklift classifications is helpful as you focus on finding the ideal type of forklift or materials handling equipment for your company.</p>
