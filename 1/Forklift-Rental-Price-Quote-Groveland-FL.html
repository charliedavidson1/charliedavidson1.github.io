This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks. From reach forklifts to warehouse forklifts or rough terrain lifts - you can rely on our top-tier material handling equipment.</p>
<p>Our versatile Furniture Orderpickers enable you to equip your truck with the ideal fork length with extended baselegs for rail guidance application; select from varying fork lengths ranging from 42-96 inches. Generally, the forklift's wheels and frame are designed for a specific tire type, so check the forklift's manual before going with a different tire type than what is recommended.</p>

<p>Rough-terrain forklifts with telescopic booms are a unique category offering longer horizontal reach, and some models can swivel a full 360 degrees for improved maneuverability. While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts. As the fork lift trucks are usually quite expensive, many industry enterprises choose to buy used forklifts on industrial auctions, which reduces the cost of the process they implement.</p>
