<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment?

They are outfitted with an open operator window in order to lift operators up to warehouse racks and carry individual units of inventory.

Doosan's new 7 Series PLUS Reach Truck combines outstanding performance, durability and convenience with the highest level of safety features, making your warehouse logistics more productive and efficient.
