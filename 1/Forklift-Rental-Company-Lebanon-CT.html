<p>Unless you are very experienced and know what to look for when inspecting a forklift, have a qualified mechanic or knowledgeable operator carry out the inspection. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
<p>Also, this rental service is available to us in many types at pocket-friendly rates. To operate an order-picking forklift truck you need an LO high risk work licence. Since washing a lifted truck also involves washing tires (and pretty massive ones sometimes), I would recommend using a handheld tire brush like the one pictured above for rubber sidewalls. There are different models of forklifts, and there are various forklift features that might not be the same with every model.</p>
