<p>These sorts of lifted trucks drive differently than stock models, due to the change of suspension and higher center of gravity, but can utilize mush larger tires than a factory model. Advances in machinery made life easier for warehouse personnel; one of these important innovations was the pallet jack, which is basically a type of forklift. Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>
<p>Driving with the load downhill can result in loss of the load and control of the forklift. Efficient, versatile and productive, Raymond Counterbalanced Lift Trucks perform at the highest levels.
