<h2>Used Pallet Jack Stanley</h2>

Conveniently mounted on the cowl, the hydraulic control levers allow the operator to gain access from the right or left side of the truck. Diesel forklifts are strongly recommended if the forklift will be used for heavy lifting or outdoors. Load-reach management devices can automatically restrict the reach of the forklift based on the load being handled rather than relying on the operator.</p>
