Plus, their 8,000+ rental yards means there's probably one near you already. Since Rocky Ridge trucks can be hard to find at times, most drivers have numerous questions about these vehicles, from what the lift kits do to how much experience the company has.</p>
<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach” into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

A hydraulic hand pump is powered by manual movement and meant for projects requiring portability. The "HD" in name on many of these trucks stands for "heavy duty" which is expertly brought out in full force thanks to these lifts and customizations as well as their trim levels and available engines.</p>
<p>You will commonly see these lift trucks used at construction sites to transport and lift building materials. Lift and tow heavy or extremely large loads efficiently and safely in rough terrain environments with power and precision.

<p>Sunbelt Rentals offers a variety of forklift equipment for any type of project. So, unless you're asking for a specific type of lift truck by name, you likely want a forklift. Our type of forklift at the Western Illinois University physical plant is a sit down rider type with the forklift that has a counterbalance in the rear. No forklift operator can predict every possible event.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing. Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>
<p>Our friendly staff will work with you closely to better understand your operations and requirements, and help you choose the right forklift. Forklifts were first invented during early part of the 20th century and now had become a vital part of the modern-day industrial world. Their high capacity of up to three tons and easy manoeuvrability in tight spaces make hand pallet trucks the perfect warehouse aid.</p>
<p>Whether you are trying to learn more about these extraordinary machines or perhaps looking to diversify your fleet, here are seven different categories of forklifts and a summary of how they are used. Included with the compressor will be a revolutionary "smart sensor" used to make sure your truck is always sitting at the proper ride height, regardless of what you are loading or towing.</p>
