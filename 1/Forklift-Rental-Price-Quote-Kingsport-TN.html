<p>Gap guards are used to fill in this area and make these lifted trucks look better. Our reach truck training courses are ideal as conversion training for operators already experienced and skilled in using typical counterbalance fork lifts, with a range of the essential skills and knowledge crossing over between the two.

A lifted suspension, though it's protected from scraping over rocks and debris, responds differently to this stress; if you lift your Jeep's suspension, your standard shocks might not do the trick.
