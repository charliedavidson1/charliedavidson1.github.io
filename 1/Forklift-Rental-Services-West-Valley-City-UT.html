<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Keep these statistics in mind while training workers and safely operating forklifts. This additional clearance requires installing larger tires and in order to do that, you need to get everything up off the ground more. Yale Materials Handling Corporation markets a full line of materials handling lift truck products and services, including electric, gas, LP-gas and diesel powered lift trucks; narrow aisle, very narrow aisle and motorized hand trucks.</p>
<p>Outfit your shop with confidence, knowing that Gray jacks and Gray lifts are some of the best jacking and lifting products on the market and backed not only by a manufacturer lifetime warranty but also quick and convenient repairs from Ohio Power Tool.
