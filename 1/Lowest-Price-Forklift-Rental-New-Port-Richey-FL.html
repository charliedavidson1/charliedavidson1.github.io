<p>Most forklift dealerships rent their forklifts on daily, weekly and monthly contracts. We've engineered the H Series forklifts to be the best at both. To counter this trend and the associated challenges for the driver and reach truck, Linde has developed features such as Dynamic Mast Control to compensate for mast oscillation, introduced numerous measures to optimize visibility, and incorporated load displays.</p>
<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
