The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the test load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.</p>

<h3>Forklift Truck Brands Warsaw MO</h3>

Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure.

All forklift operators should be certified and keep their training up to date, for their safety and that of those around them.
