Forklifts are commonly used in warehousing, storeroom, supply chain, and distribution environments.

<p>Also, the Entry Bar Safety Switch at the compartment opening on Crown's stand-up and counterbalance reach trucks slows the truck to a stop and sounds an alarm if operators attempt to drive the truck with part of their foot resting on the ledge. This makes the global pallet truck market fragmented in nature. A pallet jack scale or a pallet truck scale can typically lift 120 mm.</p>
<p>These IC forklifts are ideal for manufacturing plants and construction sites, where operators need versatility to handle multiple tasks and rugged reliability to navigate rough terrain, unpredictable weather and heavy loads.
