United Rentals, a popular nationwide rental company, offers a 41-49 foot boom lift truck for $463 per day or $3,474 per month.</p>
<p>They offer numerous models that can suit any materials handling job. Order pickers work best in warehouses that operate for library archival storage, retail applications and furniture picking. Different forklifts are made for different loading capacity and height of pallet racks. While some lifts, like body lifts, are actually pretty straightforward, a mighty suspension lift can require a lot of extra considerations, parts, and work.</p>

Better visibility With a lifted truck you are situated higher giving you better visibility.

<h3>Stand Up Forklift Shelby NC</h3>
<p>Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance. We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
<p>7. Teletrucks - Short for telescopic hander forklift, these devices are another option for users that are tasked with high lifting or facilitation of mezzanine storage.
