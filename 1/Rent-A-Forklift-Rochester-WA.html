We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
