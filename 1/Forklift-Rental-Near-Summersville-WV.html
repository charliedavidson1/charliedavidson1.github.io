<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>

Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>3-wheel forklifts are typically more maneuverable than 4-wheel machines. Your crew can easily drive these machines through small openings and use them in tight workspaces.
