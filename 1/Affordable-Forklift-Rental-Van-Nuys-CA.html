In honor of National Forklift Safety Day on June 12, we present our annual ranking of the 10 (actually, 11 due to a tie for 10th place) largest global manufacturers of forklifts, as ranked by revenue. Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>
<p>Make that used custom lifted Ford F-150 or Toyota Tacoma yours with our help.

For moving unusually heavy loads manually, BT Heavy Lifter allows for safe and efficient handling with minimal effort. In addition to this, to meet the demands of our customers, we also customize this rental service as per their necessities.</p>
