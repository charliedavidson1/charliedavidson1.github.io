<p>If you purchased a truck with a lift kit and you're not certain of its lift height, you'll need to measure the difference between the factory ride height (found in your truck's service manual) and its current ride height. In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge. Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator stands, a vertical clearance of at least 74 inches should be maintained from the platform where he stands to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>

If low clearances are an issue, CASE offers freelift masts that allow you to raise the forks 5 ft off the ground prior to the mast protruding, keeping your overall travel height lower.</p>
