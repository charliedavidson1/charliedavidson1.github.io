Our Forklift Service department and Forklift Parts department is proud to offer service and parts for all major forklift brands. The larger tires allowed by lifted trucks is one of the biggest advantages for going off-road with this type of vehicle.</p>
<p>It's not as easy to see vehicles around your lifted truck, especially if they're smaller passenger occupant vehicles or bikes. Like an articulated forklift, a pivoting-mast forklift can rotate its mast at a 90-degree angle to its body. That's why it's nice to rent a forklift when required.

Of course, Chevrolet already produces a number of fantastic off-road trucks with dedicated trims designed to take on a wide range of trails out there. They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
<p>There is nothing like the ride that is achieved from air suspension. The order picker forklift has a small platform big enough for the operator to stand behind the forks with controls for operating the forks. Suspension lift kits can raise a truck a full foot from where it started, and they aren't just lifting up the truck's body and putting it back again.
