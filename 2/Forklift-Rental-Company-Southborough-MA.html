An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load.

As one of the leading forklift companies in Melbourne and throughout Victoria, we can provide you with high-quality solutions for your particular project - whatever that might be.

<h3>Still Forklift Southborough MA</h3>
<p>Right now, drivers absolutely love vehicles capable of off-road driving. Their decision to go with a Liftking product was in part due to the versatility of Liftking's robust rough-terrain forklift,” says Mark Aldrovandi, sales manager at Liftking. The most important things to know when you choose a forklift are its size, lift and load capacity, and configuration.</p>
<p>It is used for material handling inside warehouses. Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
<p>And, of course, a big, lifted monster truck just looks extremely cool. For Xtreme, limiting the turning radius of the machines is a focus, and the three larger models have an outside turning radius of 13 feet 7 inches. ICE forklifts can handle loads of up to 15,500 pounds and are ideal for indoor operation on smooth floors. Most rough terrain forklifts within this range are run by a single joystick that controls all boom functions and hydraulics for simple and efficient operation.</p>
