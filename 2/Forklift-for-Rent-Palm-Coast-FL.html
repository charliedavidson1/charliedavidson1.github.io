<p>Our range of products include Order Picker Forklift and Forklift Truck. Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again. When you're looking to buy a forklift in Bristol, the first thing you should do is pick up the phone to us. It may well be that you already know exactly what you want, in which case we will provide you with a quote.</p>
<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach” into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<h2>Lifting & Material Handling Palm Coast </h2>
<p>3. 3 Acknowledgment OSHA's Office of Training and Education wishes to acknowledge the following for contributing some of the graphics used in this presentation:  Caterpillar Lift Trucks  Mason Contractors Association of America  Industrial Truck Association  State of Utah Labor Commission - Occupational Safety & Health Division  Steamship Trade Association of Baltimore  Taylor Machine Works, Inc.</p>
<p>The goal of the course is to help small businesses become self-sufficient regarding forklift operator training (upon successfully attending the class, individuals are certified to train fellow workers at their own place of employment). The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>
<p>Transmissions on forklifts, in particular, can be subject to abuse. When not used for picking, these trucks can also be used for the transport or stacking of pallets. With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications.</p>
