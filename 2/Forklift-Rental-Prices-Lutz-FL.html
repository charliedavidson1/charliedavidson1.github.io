<p>Supporting a forklift platform is operated on a firm flat surface. If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast. With maximum lift capacities of 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, JCB's 930 and 940 rough-terrain, straight-mast forklift models are purpose-built with a one-piece frame.</p>

The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
