<p>Our versatile Furniture Orderpickers enable you to equip your truck with the ideal fork length with extended baselegs for rail guidance application; select from varying fork lengths ranging from 42-96 inches.

Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of lift trucks and other materials handling equipment.</p>

<p>In addition to forklifts, BigRentz has lifts, trucks, and construction equipment available.

The offered trucks are utilized for various material handling applications in a host of industries. These pallet trucks are manufactured using excellent quality raw material and newest technology by our qualified professionals. We are largest supplier and importer of Full Electric Pallet Truck.</p>
