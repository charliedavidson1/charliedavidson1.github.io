<p>Before you decide to lift your truck, it's important to understand some of the pros and cons of driving a lifted vehicle. If your forklift is overloaded, it can cause it to tip to the side when you turn or when you are near a steep edge. Forklifts run on diesel, liquid propane and electric. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>

<p>Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance. We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
<p>Reach forklifts exemplify these features as they can reach higher storage levels than standard models and have a better control response time. Standard 2-ton counterbalance forklifts can cost over $20,000 in good condition, and many cost much more when brought brand new. BakerCorp is a leading provider of tank, pump, filtration and trench shoring rentals, with about 950 employees, 46 locations in North America, and another 11 locations in Europe.</p>

Keep in mind that forklift rentals aren't the only warehouse equipment leases we'll do - floor cleaning equipment, personnel carriers, burden carriers and more are all available to rent out. Rough-terrrain lifts are particularly prone to abuse if they were employed at a construction site.</p>
