There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture. One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced — meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability. Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>
<p>Lift Capacity: 12000 lbs. The Raymond 5000 Series order pickers deliver exceptional versatility, intuitive handling and easy maintenance.

Comparable to the height capacity of a standard forklift, the outrigger legs on the front of the machine can support the load up to more than 30 feet.

A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>With over 80 years' experience in the materials handling industry, we've developed a range of robust, efficient and performance enhancing forklift trucks and warehouse equipment; ensuring your applications are completed efficiently, safely and smoothly.
