<p>Lift kits can put added pressure on the driveshaft angles , causing intense vibrations at peak speeds. If you require an order picking forklift that can utilised for high racking situations, we have a range that can complete these tasks with ease. Moreover, an optical sensor mounted on the load section can automatically lower pallets to an ideal working height.</p>
