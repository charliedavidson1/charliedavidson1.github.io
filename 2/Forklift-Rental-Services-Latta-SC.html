It is also not a substitute for a powered industrial truck operator training program. These calculations take into account variations in design including tire, mast, and other deflections, and provide a means for predicting with reasonable accuracy the stability of fork trucks.

<p>Class VII - Rough terrain forklift is a generic term used to describe forklifts typically intended for use on unimproved natural terrain and disturbed terrain construction sites. Also, 4,000 lb. trucks use a heavier battery to counteract the heavier load on the forks. The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>All types of dockboards should be designed and maintained so the end edges will have a substantial contact with the dock (or loading platform) and the carrier to prevent the dockboard from rocking of sliding. The increased tire size and ground clearance makes off-roading increasingly possible by limiting the potential damage of debris, as well as providing an overall smoother ride across the rough ground.</p>
<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>
