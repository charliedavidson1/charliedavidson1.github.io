Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in.

<p>Forklifts have different shapes and sizes, also meet different and varied purposes. An additional set of wheels allows pallet truck to be moved sideways in addition to being the conventional forward and back directions.

Lifted trucks are never seen in New England, the New York area, the Miami area, or Hollywood.</p>
<p>These types of powered industrial trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and have pneumatic (air filled) tires. Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
