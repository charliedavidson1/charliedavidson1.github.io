You'll need to raise your truck a lot and put on improved suspension components (shocks, springs, etc.) if you're thinking of really going off-road.

Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts. However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
