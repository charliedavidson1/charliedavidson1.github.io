<p>It is used for material handling inside warehouses. Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
<p>Driving such a mess would be grounds for ridicule and a reminder that the driver is a low-class yokel redneck from the uncultured fly-over states. Keep in mind that forklift rentals aren't the only warehouse equipment leases we'll do - floor cleaning equipment, personnel carriers, burden carriers and more are all available to rent out. Rough-terrrain lifts are particularly prone to abuse if they were employed at a construction site.</p>

It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts. Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>

Advancements in fuel technologies has led to a proliferation of different fuel types for standard similar sized forklifts including LPG, CNG and battery electric units. A truck with a lift kit has a higher center of gravity than a stock truck from the factory.</p>
